Multi-Code is a proposed tool that should allow developers to work on a project in differnt programming languages. Developers will be able to program in their preferred language even when a project is written in a different language.

## Features
- **Cross language collaboration**. Work on the same project using different programming language.
- **Real Time Updates**. Get updates from other team members as they write or save.
- **Instant Code Translation**. Write code in one language which gets added into the project in its targeted language.

## Limitations
- You cannot work on library or framework specific projects. Converting library or framework specific code is complex and requires more thought process.

## Technologies
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for sockets.
- [React.js](https://react.dev/) for frontend.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for backend.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for data storage.
